    "Splenomegaly can indicate various underlying conditions, including infections, liver disease, or blood disorders. Accurate measurement of spleen size is essential in clinical practice to diagnose and monitor these conditions. In this assignment, we will specifically focus on measuring the **maximum anterior-posterior (AP) width** of the spleen on transverse CT slices. This is the longest distance between the anterior (front) and posterior (back) parts of the spleen in a given transverse (parallel to the floor when standing) slice. See the photos above for an explanation of these terms (spleen width is labeled as “Width” on the transverse plane image).\n",

    "### Medical Imaging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical images like **CT (Computed Tomography)**, **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**, and **X-rays** provide detailed insights into the human body. CT images, in particular, are widely used in diagnosing conditions involving internal organs. These images are essentially 3D scans reconstructed into slices, which are 2D cross-sectional views of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Voxel-Based Images?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular 2D images made up of pixels, CT images are **voxel-based**. A voxel (volumetric pixel) represents a 3D volume of space, capturing more detailed spatial information. Each CT scan is a 3D array of voxels, often represented as a **NumPy array** in Python, where the dimensions correspond to the axial (X), coronal (Y), and sagittal (Z) planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A CT image might have a shape of `(512, 512, 100)`, where:\n",
    "    - `512 x 512` corresponds to the width and height of each 2D slice.\n",
    "    - `100` represents the number of slices along the Z-axis (depth).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voxel Size:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each voxel has a physical size in millimeters, known as **voxel spacing**. This size determines the real-world dimensions represented by each voxel. The voxel size is typically provided in the CT scan metadata as `[row_spacing, col_spacing, slice_thickness]`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A voxel size of `[0.78125, 0.78125, 3.0]` means:\n",
    "    - Each pixel represents `0.78125 mm` in the axial plane (X-Y).\n",
    "    - The distance between slices is `3.0 mm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurately interpreting voxel sizes is critical for converting measurements (e.g., spleen width) from pixels to real-world units (millimeters)."
